### teamPetty

**teamPetty** came from the need to record histories of fun casual games such as **Among Us** in order to keep track of memorable games and maintain bragging rights. Some could argue that the game developers *should* have made these functionalities available in the first place but we decided to just make it for them :)

## How to use
