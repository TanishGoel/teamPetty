# teamPetty

**teamPetty** came from the need to record histories of fun casual games such as **Among Us** in order to keep track of memorable games and maintain bragging rights. Some could argue that the game developers *should* have made these functionalities available in the first place but we decided to just make it for them :)

## How to use
1. Download the respository.
2. Open the terminal. 
3. cd into the project folder.
4. Type `npm start`
5. Enjoy!

## How we built it
We made use of Node.js, React, HTML and CSS to build a simple web app.

## Challenges we ran into
We were all very new to web app development (and hackathons in general) so it was quite a struggle.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It's semi-functional.

## What we learned
Basically everything you see today has been learned in the past 24hours.

## Future Extensions
1. Expand the webapp for other games such as Skribbl.io and Covidopoly.
2. Allow users to award titles to each other after each game.
